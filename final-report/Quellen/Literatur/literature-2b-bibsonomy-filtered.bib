  abstract = {Modern data-driven frameworks often have to process large amounts of data periodically. Hence, they often operate under time or space constraints. This also holds for Linked Data-driven frameworks when processing RDF data, in particular, when they perform link discovery tasks. In this work, we present a novel approach for link discovery under constraints pertaining to the expected recall of a link discovery task. Given a link specification, the approach aims to find a subsumed link specification that achieves a lower run time than the input specification while abiding by a predefined constraint on the expected recall it has to achieve. Our approach, dubbed LIGER, combines downward refinement oper- ators with monotonicity assumptions to detect such specifications. We evaluate our approach on seven datasets. Our results suggest that the different implemen- tations of LIGER can detect subsumed specifications that abide by expected recall constraints efficiently, thus leading to significantly shorter overall run times than our baseline.},

@inproceedings{ligon_om_2020,
  abstract = {Link discovery plays a key role in the integration and use of data across RDF knowledge graphs. Active learning approaches are a common family of solutions to address the problem of learning how to compute links from users. So far, only active learning from perfect oracles has been considered in the literature. However, real oracles are often far from perfect (e.g., in crowdsourcing). We hence study the problem of learning how to compute links across knowledge graphs from noisy oracles, i.e., oracles that are not guaranteed to return correct classification results. We present a novel approach for link discovery based on a probabilistic model, with which we estimate the joint odds of the oracles’ guesses. We combine this approach with an iterative learning approach based on refinements. The resulting method, Ligon, is evaluated on 10 benchmark datasets. Our results suggest that Ligon configured with 10 iterations and 10 training examples per iteration achieves more than 95% of the F-measure achieved by state-of-the-art algorithms trained with a perfect oracle. Moreover, Ligon outperforms batch learning approaches devised to be trained with small amounts of training data by more than 40% F-measure on average.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present LimesWebUI, our web interface of Limes. Limes, the Link Discovery Framework for Metric Spaces, is a framework for dis- covering links between entities contained in Linked Data sources. LimesWebUI assists the end user during the link discovery process. By representing the link specifications (LS) as interlocking blocks, our interface eases the manual creation of links for users who already know which LS they would like to execute. How- ever, most users do not know which LS suits their linking task best and therefore need help throughout this process. Hence, our interface provides wizards which allow the easy configuration of many link discovery machine learning algorithms, that does not require the user to enter a manual LS. We evaluate the usability of the interface by using the standard system usability scale questionnaire. Our over- all usability score of 76.5 suggests that the online interface is consistent, easy to use, and the various functions of the system are well integrated.},

@inproceedings{JointModel2019,
  abstract = {Existing technologies employ different machine learning approaches to predict disasters from historical environmental data. However, for short-term disasters (e.g., earthquakes), historical data alone has a limited prediction capability. 
In this work, we consider social media as a supplementary source of knowledge in addition to historical environmental data. Further, we build a joint model that learns from disaster-related tweets and environmental data to improve prediction. 
We propose the combination of semantically-enriched word embedding to represent entities in tweets with their semantics representations computed with the traditional word2vec. Our experiments show that our proposed approach outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art models in disaster prediction.},
