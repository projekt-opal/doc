  abstract = {
The Linked Data paradigm builds upon the backbone of distributed knowledge bases connected by typed links. The mere volume of current knowledge bases as well as their sheer number pose two major challenges when aiming to support the computation of links across and within them. The first is that tools for link discovery have to be time-efficient when they compute links. Secondly, these tools have to produce links of high quality to serve the applications built upon Linked Data well. Solutions to the second problem build upon efficient computational approaches developed to solve the first and combine these with dedicated machine learning techniques. The current version of the LIMES framework is the product of seven years of research on these two challenges. A series of machine learning techniques and efficient computation approaches were developed and integrated into this framework to address the link discovery problem. The framework combines these diverse algorithms within a generic and extensible architecture. In this article, we give an overview of version 1.7.4 of the open-source release of the framework. In particular, we focus on an overview of the architecture of the framework, an intuition of its inner workings and a brief overview of the approaches it contains. Some descriptions of the applications within which the framework was used complete the paper. Our framework is open-source and available under a GNU license at https: //github.com/dice-group/LIMES together with a user manual and a developer manual.},

@article{AHMED2021101874,
  abstract = {The number and size of datasets abiding by the Linked Data paradigm increase every day. Discovering links between these datasets is thus central to achieving the vision behind the Data Web. Declarative Link Discovery (LD) frameworks rely on complex Link Specification (LS) to express the conditions under which two resources should be linked. Understanding such LS is not a trivial task for non-expert users. Particularly when such users are interested in generating LS to match their needs. Even if the user applies a machine learning algorithm for the automatic generation of the required LS, the challenge of explaining the resultant LS persists. Hence, providing explainable LS is the key challenge to enable users who are unfamiliar with underlying LS technologies to use them effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we extend our previous work (Ahmed et al., 2019) by proposing a generic multilingual approach that allows verbalization of LS in many languages, i.e., converts LS into understandable natural language text. In this work, we ported our LS verbalization framework into German and Spanish, in addition to English language. Our adequacy and fluency evaluations show that our approach can generate complete and easily understandable natural language descriptions even by lay users. Moreover, we devised an experimental neural approach for improving the quality of our generated texts. Our neural approach achieves promising results in terms of BLEU, METEOR and chrF++.},

  abstract = {With the growth in number and variety of RDF datasets comes an in- creasing need for both scalable and accurate solutions to support link discovery at instance level within and across these datasets. In contrast to ontology matching, most linking frameworks rely solely on string similarities to this end. The limited use of semantic similarities when linking instances is partly due to the current literature stating that they (1) do not improve the F-measure of instance linking approaches and (2) are impractical to use because they lack time efficiency. We revisit the combination of string and semantic similarities for linking instances. Contrary to the literature, our results suggest that this combination can improve the F-measure achieved by instance linking systems when the combination of the measures is performed by a machine learning approach. To achieve this in- sight, we had to address the scalability of semantic similarities. We hence present a framework for the rapid computation of semantic similarities based on edge counting. This runtime improvement allowed us to run an evaluation of 5 bench- mark datasets. Our results suggest that combining string and semantic similarities can improve the F-measure by up to 6% absolute.},

  abstract = {Modern data-driven frameworks often have to process large amounts of data periodically. Hence, they often operate under time or space constraints. This also holds for Linked Data-driven frameworks when processing RDF data, in particular, when they perform link discovery tasks. In this work, we present a novel approach for link discovery under constraints pertaining to the expected recall of a link discovery task. Given a link specification, the approach aims to find a subsumed link specification that achieves a lower run time than the input specification while abiding by a predefined constraint on the expected recall it has to achieve. Our approach, dubbed LIGER, combines downward refinement oper- ators with monotonicity assumptions to detect such specifications. We evaluate our approach on seven datasets. Our results suggest that the different implemen- tations of LIGER can detect subsumed specifications that abide by expected recall constraints efficiently, thus leading to significantly shorter overall run times than our baseline.},

  abstract = {Link discovery plays a key role in the integration and use of data across RDF knowledge graphs. Active learning approaches are a common family of solutions to address the problem of learning how to compute links from users. So far, only active learning from perfect oracles has been considered in the literature. However, real oracles are often far from perfect (e.g., in crowdsourcing). We hence study the problem of learning how to compute links across knowledge graphs from noisy oracles, i.e., oracles that are not guaranteed to return correct classification results. We present a novel approach for link discovery based on a probabilistic model, with which we estimate the joint odds of the oracles’ guesses. We combine this approach with an iterative learning approach based on refinements. The resulting method, Ligon, is evaluated on 10 benchmark datasets. Our results suggest that Ligon configured with 10 iterations and 10 training examples per iteration achieves more than 95% of the F-measure achieved by state-of-the-art algorithms trained with a perfect oracle. Moreover, Ligon outperforms batch learning approaches devised to be trained with small amounts of training data by more than 40% F-measure on average.},

By representing the link specifications (LS) as interlocking blocks, our interface eases the manual creation of links for users who already know which LS they would like to execute. How- ever, most users do not know which LS suits their linking task best and therefore need help throughout this process. Hence, our interface provides wizards which allow the easy configuration of many link discovery machine learning algorithms, that does not require the user to enter a manual LS. We evaluate the usability of the interface by using the standard system usability scale questionnaire. Our over- all usability score of 76.5 suggests that the online interface is consistent, easy to use, and the various functions of the system are well integrated.},

Linked Data paradigm is published everyday. Discovering links
between these datasets is thus central to achieving the vision behind the Data Web. Declarative Link Discovery (LD) frameworks
rely on complex Link Specification (LS) to express the conditions
under which two resources should be linked. Complex LS combine similarity measures with thresholds to determine whether
a given predicate holds between two resources. State of the art
LD frameworks rely mostly on string-based similarity measures
such as Levenshtein and Jaccard. However, string-based similarity measures often fail to catch the similarity of resources with
phonetically similar property values when these property values
are represented using different string representation (e.g., names
and street labels). In this paper, we evaluate the impact of using
phonetics-based similarities in the process of LD.
Moreover, we evaluate the impact of phonetic-based similarity
measures on a state-of-the-art machine learning approach used
to generate LS. Our experiments suggest that the combination
of string-based and phonetic-based measures can improve the Fmeasures achieved by LD frameworks on most datasets.},

  abstract = {Existing technologies employ different machine learning approaches to predict disasters from historical environmental data. However, for short-term disasters (e.g., earthquakes), historical data alone has a limited prediction capability. 
In this work, we consider social media as a supplementary source of knowledge in addition to historical environmental data. Further, we build a joint model that learns from disaster-related tweets and environmental data to improve prediction. 
We propose the combination of semantically-enriched word embedding to represent entities in tweets with their semantics representations computed with the traditional word2vec. Our experiments show that our proposed approach outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art models in disaster prediction.},

Discovering links between these datasets is thus central to achieve the vision behind the Data Web. Declarative Link Discovery (LD) frameworks rely on complex Link Specification (LS) to express the conditions under which two resources should
 be linked. Understanding such LS is not a trivial task for non-expert users, particularly when such users are interested in generating LS to match their needs. Even if the user applies a machine learning algorithm  for the automatic generation of the required LS, the challenge of explaining the resultant LS persists. Hence, providing explainable LS is the key
 challenge to enable users who are unfamiliar with underlying LS technologies to use them effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a generic approach that allows a LS to be verbalized, i.e., converted into understandable natural language. We propose a summarization approach to the verbalized LS based on the selectivity
 of the underlying LS. Our adequacy and fluency evaluations show that our approach can generate complete and easily understandable natural language descriptions even by lay users.},

@inproceedings{khanISWC2019,
  abstract = {Over years, the Web of Data has grown significantly. Various interfaces such as SPARQL endpoints, data dumps, and Triple Pattern Fragments (TPF) have been proposed to provide access to this data. Studies show that many of the SPARQL endpoints have availability issues. The data dumps do not provide live querying capabilities. The TPF solution aims to provide a trade-off between the availability and performance by dividing the workload among TPF servers and clients. In this solution, the TPF server only performs the triple patterns execution of the given SPARQL query. While the TPF client performs the joins between the triple patterns to compute the final resultset  of the SPARQL query. High availability is achieved in TPF but increase in network bandwidth and query execution time lower the performance. We want to propose a more intelligent SPARQL querying server to keep the high availability along with high query execution performance, while minimizing the network bandwidth. The proposed server will offer query execution services (can be single triple patterns or even join execution) according to the current status of the workload. If a server is free, it should be able to execute the complete SPARQL query. Thus, the server will offer execution services while avoiding going beyond the maximum query processing limit, i.e. the point after which the performance start decreasing or even service shutdown. Furthermore, we want to develop a more intelligent client, which keeps track of a server's processing capabilities and therefore avoid DOS attacks and crashes.},
